# Electric-and-Alternate-Fuel
This is an EDA project on "Electric and Alternate Fuel Charging Stations in US and Canada".

---------------------
##Project Introduction:

This is an introduction report on the project - “specifics of Electric/Alternate 
fuel Vehicle charging stations in the US and Canada”. 

---------------------
##About the dataset: 

The dataset – “Electric and Alternative Fuel Charging Stations 2022”, 
contains data on different types of alternative fuel available in the US and Canada, 
having information starting from 2017 to 2022.

The dataset also contains Historical stations count by state starting from 
2007 to 2021. The data is verified using The National Renewal Energy Laboratory
(NREL) in the US and The National Resources Canada (NRCan) in Canada, which 
update any new and check existing charging stations annually to provide accurate 
information.

No. of rows = 70,406
No. of columns = 65

---------------------

##Reason for selecting this dataset:

From electric cars and propane vehicles to natural gas-powered buses and 
trucks that run on biodiesel, today’s options for alternative fuel are very vast.
Increasing the use of alternative fuels and vehicles will help reduce consumers’ fuel 
costs, minimize pollution and increase the nation’s energy security.

By using alternative fuels we can reduce pollution, protect against global 
warming, reduce wastage, frequently produce domestically, reduce unrest and 
conflict on current fossil fuels, and help farmers(by using biofuels that depend on 
crops). These all-use cases made me interested in selecting this dataset as my 
project

--------------------

##Approach for this project:

• We will first import the required libraries and datasets for the project.
• Interpret different columns
• Checking for null values in different columns
• Performing missing values techniques
• Dropping or Discarding empty columns
• Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis
• Data visualization

--------------------

##Goals and Plans:

• Analyze the different types of alternate fuels in charging stations available
• Analyze the growth of different alternate fuel charging stations
• Analyze the historical change in fuel stations
• Analyze the biggest competitor alternate fuel 
• Analyze the growth of Electric charging stations
• Analyze different types of alternate fuel and electric chargers
